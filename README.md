## üîß What it Does

This MCP server allows you to ask questions like:

> *‚ÄúWhat are my bin collections for 51 Gosbrook Road, RG48BN?‚Äù*

‚Ä¶directly within Claude. It looks up the postcode and house number via Reading Borough Council's API and returns your upcoming collection dates.

---

## üöÄ Quickstart

### 1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vaughanc/collections.git
```
### 2. Install UV

```
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

```
Make sure to restart your terminal afterwards to ensure that the uv command gets picked up.

### 3. Create a virtual environment

```
uv init collections
uv venv                                                   
source .venv/bin/activate
uv run fastmcp install --with uvicorn --with requests collections.py
```

The install command will create the config for Claude to detect the MCP server.

You can check this in the following file
```

cat  ~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json 
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "Reading Bin Collections Tool": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "--with",
        "fastmcp",
        "--with",
        "requests",
        "--with",
        "uvicorn",
        "fastmcp",
        "run",
        "/Users/chris/Documents/Code/collections/collections.py"
      ]
    }
    }
  }

```
When you start Claude you should see the following

I used this quickstart guide to provide the background to get going.

I also may have used brew to resolve some dependencies such as NPM but can't recall.
